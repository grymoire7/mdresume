I'm a polyglot that enjoys solving problems with software. I enjoy working, learning, and
teaching on a collaborative team. I have a passion for creating quality, extensible code and
having a positive impact on my team, my company, and those around me. Let’s face it, having
a positive impact is fun. Most recently I enjoyed building AI features, from ideas to
implementation to delivery and support, into a best-in-class learning platform to generate
question content and categories for our customers.

As a full-stack developer at BenchPrep, I helped deliver a high-quality SaaS
platform serving the education market. In my role as team lead, I led the
transition to container-based development and helped chart a path to CI/CD. I
worked daily with test engineering, product management, and customer support to
clarify requirements, design and implement timely solutions, and maintain
existing systems. I integrated AI features into the BenchPrep platform and
crafted code to generate question content and suggest categories for clients.
In addition to being a team lead, I also enjoyed leading a Refactoring SIG and
giving frequent technical talks to Engineering and other groups to help advance
our skills and knowledge as a company.

I delivered high quality code as part of a cross-functional team that enabled
data-driven decisions at Groupon through building tools that run and analyze
A/B experimentation. I worked with data scientists, product managers, multiple
departments, and created written and video traning marterial to help other
departemnts understand and use the A/B experimentation tools we built.

**Technologies used:** Ruby on Rails, Python, PostgreSQL, AWS, Rspec, Git

### Oracle – Principal Member Technical Staff

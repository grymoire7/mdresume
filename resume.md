I'm a polyglot that enjoys solving problems with software. I enjoy working, learning, and
teaching on a collaborative team. I have a passion for creating quality, extendable code and
having a positive impact on my team, my company, and those around me. Let’s face it, having
a positive impact is fun. Most recently I enjoyed building AI features, from ideas to
implementation to delivery and support, into a best-in-class learning platform to generate
question content and categories for our customers.

## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer, BenchPrep

July 2020 - September 2024, Chicago, IL and remote

As a full-stack developer at BenchPrep, I helped deliver a high-quality SaaS
platform serving the education market using Ruby on Rails, Vue, Docker, and
PostgreSQL. In my role as team lead, I led the transition to container-based
development and helped chart a path to CI/CD. I worked daily with test
engineering, product management, and customer support to clarify requirements,
design and implement timely solutions, and maintain existing systems. 
I integrated AI features into the BenchPrep platform and crafted code to
generate question content and suggest categories for clients. In addition to
being a team lead, I also enjoyed leading a Refactoring SIG and giving frequent
technical talks to Engineering and other groups to help advance our skills and
knowledge as a company.
